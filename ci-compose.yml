# This Compose file is meant to be used along the project's `docker-compose.yml`
# file on CI/CD contexts, such as SemaphoreCI or Github Actions.
#
# A useful alias to run this on your CI/CD pipelines:
# `alias ci-compose="docker-compose --file docker-compose.yml --file ci-compose.yml"`

# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#understanding-multiple-compose-files
